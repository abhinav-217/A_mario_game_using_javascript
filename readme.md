A simple javascript game using html css and javascript

You can try this game it's quite fun to play

The score gets updated every time you jump over the enemy

The mario character changes from the running to the jumping When you jump over the enemy
I have handled that from the javascript it was quite challenging for me as I am a begginer but I have done it and the game works just completely fine
